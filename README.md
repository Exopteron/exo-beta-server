# exo-beta-server
Exo's Minecraft Beta server heavily inspired by feather-rs

No license. This means for now, all rights reserved.

A lot of code was inspired by feather-rs. I'm reasonably sure this is fine under the license, at least I hope so..

This is not fully functional. More features are being added all the time!
## Current features:
* World generation/saving/loading in a custom format (Region format support soon!)
* Crafting
* Health/damage/PVP
* Items
* Weather
* Tools 

## Goals:
* Make a fully functional b1.7.3 server (maybe skip redstone)
* Make a FAST fully functional b1.7.3 server
* Make a fully vanilla-compliant server
* Upgrade to b1.8?

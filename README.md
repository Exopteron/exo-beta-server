# exo-beta-server
Exo's Minecraft Beta server heavily inspired by feather-rs

No license. This means for now, all rights reserved.

A lot of code was inspired by feather-rs. I'm reasonably sure this is fine under the license, at least I hope so..

## Goals:
* Make a fully functional b1.7.3 server (maybe skip redstone)
* Make a FAST fully functional b1.7.3 server
* Upgrade to b1.8?

# exo-beta-server
Exo's Minecraft Beta server heavily ~~inspired by~~ thieved from feather-rs

GPLv3 license

A lot of code was ~~inspired by~~ completely nicked from feather-rs. I'm reasonably sure this is fine under the license, at least I hope so..

## Current features:
* region file format
* chunk loading
* see other people!

Test server: `beta-test.exopteron.com`
